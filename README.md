#### Table

Data                    | Render                | Simulation             | Event
----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------
Organic Shapes        |Main organic shapes |Main Organic pattern |Person Walking on simulation
Where theyre located  |Color of the shapes |Color of the pattern |Under person the path is yellow
What color            |Path thats created ||Path created turns orange
Person tracking       |Color of path fading ||Pattern refilling path that was created
Path created shape    | |
Color of path fading  |  |

## What are we seeing

An interactive surface
  - Shapes (Brain Pattern)
  - Everytime a person passes a path is created between shapes, restricted within the brain pattern.
  - Slight delay after step
  - Most current Step is yellow as person walks away color fades to orange
  - As person walks away path is being filled in with brain pattern again

#### Table

Data                    | Render                | Simulation             | Event
----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------
Random Shapes from a small set/group of objects|Background Grey| Video Recording of event happening|Voice Speaks objects rotates
Oscillating rotation location   |Random Shapes at random amounts from library||Pitch/volume changes drastically
Voice/Recording|||Objects drastically moving to the change in pitches
Pitch of voice and loudness tracking|||

## What are we seeing

A video instillation
  - 3 Voices Speaking
  - Blob of moving objects in correspondance with the voices
  - Random shapes/objects rendered to rotate and oscillate at random direction and speed
  - Conceptual: Human to nonhuman compare and contrast
